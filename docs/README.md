Move in the `visualizer` folder and run `python3 ConnectionHandler.py` to open the web application.

There you have different buttons:

- `Start`: starts the execution of the scheduling algorithm.
- `New Task`: add a new task in the current execution.
- `Add Time`: add a selected amount of time in the current execution.
- `Print Graph`: print a diagram of the current execution with the different executing tasks in the various time instances. You can also insert the time interval where you want to see the task execution
- `Select and Upload XML File`: Select an XML file from your pc to be executed.
- `Create XML`: You can create an XML file by choosing the starting configuration and the tasks that you want with the command `Add New Task`. The file will be saved in the `visualizer/Input` folder.
- `Download CSV`: save the result in a csv format.
- `Download XML` : save the created XML file.
