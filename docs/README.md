## Introduction

The goal of the project is to implement a scheduling software, which simulates various task scheduling techniques.
It has been developed to implement a simple python interface and a web GUI for end-users.

## Schedsim

The algorithm implements the following scheduling algorithms: FIFO, SJF, HRRN, SRTF, RR, RM and DM. These
are divided into Non-Preemptive (FIFO, SJF, HRRN) and Preemptive (SRTF, RR, RM, DM) categories. In
Non-Preemptive scheduling, once a task begins its execution, it will not be interrupted until it finishes.
In Preemptive scheduling, tasks can start execution, pause to allow another task to execute, and then
resume. Additionally, the algorithm supports tasks that can be either periodic or sporadic, with or
without deadlines. Particularly for the RM scheduling algorithm, a Server scheduler is required to run
sporadic tasks. Four different server algorithms have been implemented: Polling, Deferrable, Priority Exchange and Sporadic.

## Algorithm

The algorithm processes each time instant, from the start to the end of the simulation period, and determines which task should be executed at each instant. To make this decision, the algorithm maintains the following lists:

- **Arrival Events**: List of events generated by the added tasks. Upon execution, the list of tasks is converted into a list of arrival events. An arrival event represents a single execution instance of the corresponding task. In case of a periodic task, N corresponding arrival events are added to the list where N is the number of task periods that stay within the execution time. In case of a sporadic task, only one arrival event is added;
- **Start Events**: List of events that are eligible to be executed. When the current time step is greater than the arrival event time, it is converted into a start event. The start event list is the pool where the scheduler picks the task to be executed at each time step. In case of preemptive scheduling, when the event is executed, it is not automatically removed from the list, but its internal execution time is inserted. Only when the execution time matches the needed one (wcet), the event is removed from the list;
- **Finish Events**: List of events that completed their execution. A check is done periodically to find events into the start event list, that completed their execution;
- **Deadline Events**: List of real time events. At each step a check is performed over this list to signal those ones that passed their deadline;

### Non Preemptive

In Non-Preemptive algorithms, for each time instant, if no task is currently executing, the events in the Arrival Events list are sorted according to the chosen scheduling algorithm. The algorithm then selects the first task in the list to be fully executed without interruption.

### Preemptive

In Preemptive algorithms, tasks can be started, interrupted, and then resumed. In SRTF, at each
time instant, the task within the Start Events list that has the shortest remaining execution time is
selected for execution. In RR, at each quantum time instant, the task to be executed is switched in a cyclic manner, following a repeated round of the tasks in the Start Events list.

## Adding task and time

To support the addition of a new task after the execution has started, various solutions have been
considered. For periodic tasks, it is impossible to add a new task without recalculating everything from the beginning, as the start time of each periodic task is tied to the start time of the scheduling.
Therefore,the optimizations described below focus on the addition of sporadic tasks.

### Basic solution

The basic solution involves saving a copy of the four lists (_Arrival Events_, _Finish Events_, _Deadline Events_, _Start Events_) at each time instant. When a new task is added, the algorithm would return to
the state corresponding to the start time of the new task and continue the execution from that point.
However, this solution is not optimal because saving a copy of the four lists at each time instant is computationally expensive. Therefore, a more efficient solution that does not require saving the state at every time instant is needed.

### Balanced binary search tree solution

An alternative solution is to use a Balanced Binary Search Tree (BBST) to save a copy of the four lists only at time instants when a new task begins execution. With this data structure, fewer copies of the lists are needed, and when a new task is added, the time to restart the execution can be found in O(log(total time)). However, this solution is less effective when tasks have short durations, or when the quantum value in Round Robin scheduling is low, which lead to frequent copies.

**Example**:<br/>
Time = 10<br/>
We suppose that at the following time instants {2, 3, 5, 7, 9}, the tasks in ”execution” change, and the tree is updated before continuing execution.
Now, consider a new task that starts at time 4. The system finds the largest element in the BBST that is smaller than or equal to 4, which is 3.
The system updates the BBST structure, restores the state from time 3, and resumes the simulation from that point until the end.
If we consider round-robin execution, the tree size remains constant at one, as the tree is updated with each time slice.

### SQRT decomposition solution

Taking the previous solutions into consideration, we opted for a data structure that saves a copy of the four lists at regular intervals. We chose an approach based on the _Square Root Decomposition Algorithm_. In this method, a copy of the four lists is saved every sqrt(time duration). When a new sporadic task arrives, the algorithm uses the most recent saved state prior to the task’s start time and then simulates the execution from that point to the end.

**Example**:<br/>
Time = 10<br/>
Size = sqrt(10) -> 3 (rounded to the nearest integer)
events_list = {events[0], events[3], events[6], events[9]}, where each events list contains four items
At time 4, a new task is introduced.
The most recent saved state before time 4 is at time 3.
The system restores the state at time 3 and resumes the simulation from there until the end.

TODO: add graph

### Implementation

When the algorithm starts executing, the interval size is calculated as the square root of the total execution time of the simulation, determining how often the states will be saved. The algorithm then simulates the tasks from the input file, saving the state of the four lists starting at time 0 and at each interval determined by the size. When a new task arrives, if it is sporadic, the time instant at which the execution will be restarted is calculated.
This time is the latest saved time instant that is smaller than or equal to the start time of the new task. The execution is then restarted from that time and proceeds as before. If additional time is added to the total duration, the list containing the arrival events needs to be updated. The new arrival events are calculated similarly to the initial ones and saved from the previous end time up to the new end time, which is equal to the previous end time plus the added time.

### Test implementation correctness

To test the correctness of the implementation, we created a script that generates two input files. The second file contains a subset of the information from the first one, with a shorter time duration and fewer tasks. The missing tasks in the second file are then added, and the total time is extended to match that of the first file. This approach is used to verify the correct functioning of the method for adding tasks and time. After execution, the two output files are then compared.

## Graphical interface

We have developed a web-based UI that can be launched using the **ConnectionHandler.py** script.

### Running the application

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Open the Schedsim folder on your device;
2. Navigate to the visualizer directory using your terminal or command prompt;
3. Run the `Connection_Handler.py` file using Python3. This will start the server that hosts the web interface;
4. Open a web browser and go to the URL http://127.0.0.1:5001/ to access the user interface;
5. Interact with the Schedsim GUI to utilize the scheduling features and visualize task execution.

The homepage of the UI looks like this:

TODO: add graph

Several buttons linked to the key features of Schedsim were created.

### Start button

This button allows you to execute the code using the **execute** function of the **Scheduler** class. The function utilizes the **self.scheduler** instance to start and terminate the execution. If **self.scheduler** is not present, the function throws an exception and quits.

### New task button

This button allows you to create a new task using the new task function of the Scheduler class, which requires several parameters defined in the Task class. There are two types of tasks:

- **Sporadic**: Requires the parameters (real_time, task_type, task_id, activation, deadline, wcet);
- **Periodic**: Requires the parameters (real_time, task_type, task_id, period, deadline, wcet).

There are several checks:

- **Task ID Check**: Verify that task_id is a positive integer. This ensures that only valid tasks are processed;
- **WCET Check**: Confirm that wcet (Worst-Case Execution Time) is a positive integer. This check ensures that the execution time provided is valid and non-zero;
- **Period and Activation Check**: For periodic tasks, ensure period is a positive integer. For sporadic tasks, ensure activation is non-negative. This prevents invalid or nonsensical timing values from being used;
- **Deadline Check**: Ensure deadline is a positive integer. This ensures that deadlines are set correctly and are valid;
- **WCET vs Period Check**: For periodic tasks, ensure wcet is less than or equal to period. This ensures that the execution time fits within the allocated period for the task;
- **Deadline vs WCET Check**: Ensure deadline is greater than wcet. This guarantees that the task has enough time to complete before its deadline;

### Add time button

This button allows you to use the **add_time** function of the **Scheduler** class. This function requires a numerical input, which adds the specified amount of time to the **scheduler.end** parameter. When this function is activated, the scheduler implicitly calls the **start** function.

TODO: add graph

### Print graph button

This button allows you to use the **create_graph** function, which automatically prints the graph with default parameters: fraction set to one, start and end set to the respective parameters of the **scheduler** instance. An additional functionality allows you to define the following parameters (**start**, **end**, **fraction**) to print the graph for a specific interval (usually the most significant). The fraction is a number in the range (1,5), while the start and end are only allowed in the range [**scheduler.start**, **scheduler.end**]. The graph displays four types of data:

- Red for the **arrival** of tasks;
- Blue for the **completion** of tasks;
- Green for the **execution** of tasks;
- Orange for the **deadline** of tasks;

### Select and upload XML file button

This button allows you to select and upload an XML file from your device to the temporary directory of the project. Checks are in place to prevent uploading files that are not in XML format.

### Create XML button

This button allows you to create a new XML file based on the input parameters (**start**, **end**, **scheduler_algorithm**). The **RR** algorithm also requires an additional parameter, **quantum**, which defines the time to assign to each task during each cycle. The **RM** algorithm requires also the server algorithm (and its parameters) for sporadic task execution.

TODO: add graph

Through the dynamic **Add New Task** button, you can add as many tasks as needed, following the same concept as the **New Task** functionality. The **Submit All Tasks** button finalizes the creation of the XML file, which you can then download using the **Download XML** button. To verify the validity and relationships among the tasks, we use the checks detailed in Section 3.2.3.

### Download CSV button

This button allows you to download the execution output in CSV format. You can only download the file if you have executed the scheduler beforehand.

TODO: add graph

### Download XML button

This button allows you to download the created XML file. You can only download the file if it was previously created using the Create XML button.

## Support file

To wrap a GUI around the Schedsim simulator, different modules have been implemented.

### SchedulerController

This class manages the interaction between the frontend and backend using an instance of a scheduler.<br/>
Its functions are:

- **Initialization**: Sets up the scheduler, temporary directories, and initializes start and end times;
- **Load XML file**: Loads an XML file to initialize the scheduler with simulation parameters;
- **Execute scheduler**: Runs the scheduler and finalizes its execution;
- **Create task**: Adds a new task to the scheduler, supporting both sporadic and periodic tasks;
- **Add new time**: Extends the simulation time by a specified amount;
- **Print graph**: Generates and saves a graph representing task execution over a specified time range;
- **Create XML**: Creates an XML file representing the simulation configuration, including tasks, scheduler, and hardware;

### Visualizer

The **create_graph** method produces a timeline visualization of task events. It uses Pandas to handle and process numerical data from a CSV file, including managing missing values and converting data types. The method filters the data according to **start_time** and **end_time**, and utilizes Matplotlib to generate a graphical representation. The graph illustrates task arrivals, executions, completions, and deadlines with distinct colors. If the data is missing or empty, an empty graph is generated. The resulting plot is saved as the image file `out.png`.

### Style

The **style.css** file defines the visual presentation of the web page elements. It includes rules for layout, color schemes, fonts, and other stylistic aspects to ensure a cohesive and aesthetically pleasing
user interface.

### Script

The **script.js** file contains JavaScript code that handles various interactions and dynamic behaviors on the web page. It manages event listeners for user actions such as button clicks and form submissions, communicates with the server via AJAX, and updates the user interface based on server responses. This script is essential for enabling interactive features and ensuring smooth functionality.

### Dynamic form

The **dynamic_form.js** file manages the dynamic behavior of the form used for creating XML files. It adjusts the visibility of form fields based on user selections (e.g., task type or scheduling algorithm) to present only relevant options. This script ensures that the form adapts in realtime to user input, improving usability and streamlining the process of configuring XML files.
